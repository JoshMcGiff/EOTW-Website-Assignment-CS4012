            <b>The aim of this project is to increase awareness of enviromental conservation,
            aswell as to combat the destruction of fragile habitats such as the melting of
            the Arctic Ice-Shelf and deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia.</b> With this project
            we aim to completely stop the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf, reduce wood
            harvesting by 60%, and plant 30,000,000 trees by 2030.

            So far, we have created a <a id = "linked" href="http://chng.it/jSpXXc44PH" target = "_blank">petition</a> which will be sent to
            various world leaders around the globe. This petition will put pressure on politicians to take 
            action against deforestation, as well as raise awareness about the issue. We also take action 
            against the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf with our <i>'Save The Polar Bears'</i> initiative. Polar 
            bears are becoming more and more endangered each day, and we want to raise awareness through 
            this project of the issue. Once we raise awareness of the issue more people will take care of
            their carbon emmisions which will in turn decellerate the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf.

            <b>The aim of this project is to reduce littering and dumping, to
            incentivise food companies to create products with better reusability
            and to put pressure on governments to introduce laws that force
            its citizens to recycle.</b> We hope that we will greatly reduce the
            volume of landfills, as well as improve containment of waste
            globally through this project.

            So far, we have intitiated a social media trend called <a id = "linked" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrashTag/" target = "_blank">
            <i>#trashtag.</i> </a>The point of this trend is for people to clean up their local area, and then
            post a picture of the area before and after the clean-up, with the hashtag <i>#trashtag</i>.
            We have also visited lots of schools around the world, emphasizing the importance of proper
            waste management to future generations.

            <b>The aim of this project is to reduce global carbon emmissions through
            promotion of electric motor vehicles and energy reduction campaigns.</b>
            We hope to put pressure on government bodies to introduce and enforce
            laws that greatly restrict energy consumption by companies and citizens.
            We hope that through this project we will contribute to a total global
            COâ‚‚ emmissions reduction of 40% by 2030.

            So far, we have created a social media campaign in which people post pictures,
            or tweets of useful methods they use to reduce their carbon footprint, with the
            hashtag <i>#StompingOnCO2</i>.We have also sent letters to variousing governing
            bodies around the globe, asking them to focus on encouraging use of electric 
            cars to the public, and to disparage the use of diesel and petrol cars.
