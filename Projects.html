                        we aim to completely stop the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf, reduce wood
                        harvesting by 60%, and plant 30,000,000 trees by 2030.

                So far, we have created a <a href="http://chng.it/jSpXXc44PH">petition</a> which will be sent to
                various world leaders around the globe. This petition will put pressure on politicians to take 
                action against deforestation, as well as raise awareness about the issue. We also take action 
                against the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf with our <i>'Save The Polar Bears'</i> initiative. Polar 
                bears are becoming more and more endangered each day, and we want to raise awareness through 
                this project of the issue. Once we raise awareness of the issue more people will take care of
                their carbon emmisions which will in turn decellerate the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf.

                We also intitiated a social media trend called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrashTag/">
                #trashtag. </a>The point of this trend is for people to clean up their local area, and then
                post a picture of the area before and after the clean-up, with the hashtag #trashtag.
