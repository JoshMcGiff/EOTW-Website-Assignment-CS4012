                The aim of this project is to increase awareness of enviromental conservation,
                aswell as to combat the destruction of fragile habitats such as the melting of
                the Arctic Ice-Shelf and deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia. With this project
                we aim to completely stop the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf, reduce wood
                harvesting by 60%, and plant 30,000,000 trees by 2030.

                The aim of this project is to reduce global carbon emmissions through
                promotion of electric motor vehicles and energy reduction campaigns.
                We hope to put pressure on government bodies to introduce and enforce
                laws that greatly restrict energy consumption by companies and citizens.
                We hope that through this project we will contribute to a total global
                COâ‚‚ emmissions reduction of 40% by 2030.

                The aim of this project is to reduce littering and dumping, to
                incentivise food companies to create products with better reusability
                and to put pressure on governments to introduce laws that force
                its citizens to recycle. We hope that we will greatly reduce the
                volume of landfills, as well as improve containment of waste
                globally through this project.
