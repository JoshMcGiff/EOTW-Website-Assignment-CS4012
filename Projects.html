            we aim to completely stop the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf, reduce wood
            harvesting by 60%, and plant 30,000,000 trees by 2030.

        So far, we have created a <a id = "link" href="http://chng.it/jSpXXc44PH">petition</a> which will be sent to
        various world leaders around the globe. This petition will put pressure on politicians to take 
        action against deforestation, as well as raise awareness about the issue. We also take action 
        against the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf with our <i>'Save The Polar Bears'</i> initiative. Polar 
        bears are becoming more and more endangered each day, and we want to raise awareness through 
        this project of the issue. Once we raise awareness of the issue more people will take care of
        their carbon emmisions which will in turn decellerate the melting of the Arctic Ice-Shelf.

        So far, we have created a social media campaign in which people post pictures,
        or tweets of useful methods they use to reduce their carbon footprint, with the
        hashtag <i>#StompingOnCO2</i>.We have also sent letters to variousing governing
        bodies around the globe, asking them to focus on encouraging use of electric 
        cars to the public, and to disparage the use of diesel and petrol cars.
