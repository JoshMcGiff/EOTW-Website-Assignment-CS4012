            <b>The best way to save our planet is to ensure that everybody else
            is taking care of it too.</b> Unfortunately, there are a lot of climate
            change skeptics, and people who can sleep well at night knowing that the
            world is turning into a landfill. It's more important now than ever that
            the human race comes together to combat pollution. Why not make a start
            by sharing this website on Twitter?
