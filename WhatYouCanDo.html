            <h2>Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</h2>

            <p>
                The human race has never had a larger carbon footprint in
                history. Our Carbon Footprint is the leading cause of Global
                Warming. If you want to help reduce, or with enough efffort reverse,
                the effects of climate change, the best way you can do so is by
                decreasing your energy consumption, as well as utilising more
                green energy instead of the energy harnessed from fossil fuels.

            <h2>Pick Up Litter</h2>

            <p>
                Unfortunately there are many people who take little regard for
                the enviroment and are more than happy to dump and litter. Not only
                is the result of these actions unsightly, but it can also cause great
                harm to wildlife. You can help by getting involved with your local

            <h2>Plant Trees</h2>

            <p>
                There is a global crisis right now with deforestation, and forest fires. The amazon rainforest
                is burning down at an alarming rate. This is worrying as trees are what convert toxic carbon
                dioxide into breathable oxygen. Trees also provide habitat to a lot of wildlife. We are doing
                as much as we can to tackle this problem at its root cause. But in the meantime, the best
                way for you to help is to plant more trees! You can plant trees in your garden, or if you don't 
                have a garden, you can donate money to <a id="link" href="https://teamtrees.org/" 
                target="_balnk">Team Trees</a> and they can plant a tree and take care of it for just $1.

            <h2>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>

            <p>
                By adhering to this <a id="link" href="https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/reduce-reuse-recycle.php" target="_balnk">
                "Three R's Rule"</a> you can reduce your carbon footprint, as well as help with humanities issue
                with waste management. It is vital that we reduce the amount of waste we produce to a minimum.
                Our oceans are spawning <a id="link" href="https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/"
                target ="blank">landmasses of garbage</a> , and its killing our sealife. Help reduce humanities waste
                output by reducing your consumption of plastic, reuseing your plastic, and finally recycling your plastic.

                <b>The best way to save our planet is to ensure that everybody else
                is taking care of it too.</b> Unfortunately, there are a lot of climate

                world is turning into a landfill. It's more important now than ever that
                the human race comes together to combat pollution. Why not make a start
